## Create hexagons of equal sized from shp_rm --------------------------
set.seed(1)
size = 0.004 # original 0.0041, no se pueden hacer más pequeños que 0.000041
hex_points <- spsample(shp_rm, type = "hexagonal", cellsize = size)
hex_grid <- HexPoints2SpatialPolygons(hex_points, dx = size)
hex_grid$area_sqm <- area(hex_grid)/1000000

## Merge census blocks data with hexagons ------------------------------
# First we get the polygons ID
#library(spatialEco)
pid <- sapply(slot(hex_grid, "polygons"), function(x) slot(x, "ID"))

# Then we assign the polygon´s ID as the rownames of a new data frame
p.df <- data.frame(ID = 1:length(hex_grid), row.names = pid) 

# We coerce the hexagons object to a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame 
# were p.df corresponds to the attributes of each hexagon, in this 
# case we only have the ID.
hex_grid <- SpatialPolygonsDataFrame(hex_grid, p.df)

# points.in.poly() assigns each block in block_centers object to
# its corresponding hexagon.
blocks_in_hex <- point.in.poly(blocks_centers, hex_grid)

# Creates vector with the hexagons ID which at least have data from
# one census block. 
id_df <- unique(blocks_in_hex$ID)

# We subset hexagons for which at least we have data from one census
# block
hex_grid <- hex_grid[hex_grid$ID %in% id_df,]

# Remove unnecessary objects from workspace
rm(blocks_centers, hex_points, p.df, id_df, pid, size)


## Add census block data to hexagon spatial poolygons data frame----------

# First we add the variable total_blocks, which indicates how many census blocks 
# fell in the same hexagon
manzanas_x_hex <- blocks_in_hex@data %>% group_by(ID) %>% dplyr::summarise(total_blocks = n())
hist(manzanas_x_hex$total_blocks)
summary(manzanas_x_hex$total_blocks)

# Merge hex_grid with new variable
hexgrid_blocks <- merge(hex_grid, manzanas_x_hex, by = "ID")


# Subset blocks_in_hex, just keep variables of interest 
# Maybe is better to use var names instead of their index.
blocks_in_hex <- blocks_in_hex[, c(1,33:150,154,155)]

# Some variables are the mean for each block, others are the total of persons
# per block. Next we get the average of those variables, hencem for some
# the values is the average of an average acrross blocks, for others
# is the average of frequencies. Think about possible consequences!!!!
blocks_in_hex@data <-  blocks_in_hex@data %>% group_by(ID) %>% 
                                summarise_all(funs(mean))

# The varaibles that are now the mean of the frequency we are going to convert 
# them to a percentage by dividing by the average total of people.
# makes sense?

# Variables that correspond to the total number of people
